# DD2424project
hyperparameter experiments

software to install: 
* virtualenv 
* jupyter notebook 

python packages:
* pytorch

TODO until next meetup (when): 

each group-member installs a functional copy of jupyter-notebook and pytorch.

each group-member makes a ipynb file and downloads the following datasets and models:
* Cifar-10 dataset 
* Resnet model for pytorch
* Densenet model for pytorch

each group-member experiments with training these networks and remembers the average amount of training time. 

each group-member also experiments with different ways to represent the progress and result of the training.

each group-member experiments with ways to save and load the pytorch models.  

P.S This does not mean we cannot talk to each other about our progress and help each other out.
